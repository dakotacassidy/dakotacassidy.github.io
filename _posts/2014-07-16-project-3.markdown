description: For this analysis, Medicaid provider hospital data from America was used that contains
survey questions answered by patients. The answers are categorized by the state they were in,
not the exact hospital. The main conclusion which can be gathered from this data is why
someone would or would not recommend a hospital in the state based on the average
percentage of patients answering the survey questions.
